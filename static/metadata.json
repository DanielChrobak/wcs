  "description": "Woulda Coulda Shoulda (WCS) is a token that embodies the bittersweet regret of missed opportunities in the crypto world. It's for those moments when you watch a token pump and think, 'I woulda bought that,' or when you hold too long and mutter, 'I coulda sold at the peak.' WCS serves as a humorous reminder of the unpredictable nature of crypto markets and the importance of learning from past decisions.",
